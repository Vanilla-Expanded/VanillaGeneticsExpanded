	<description>Vanilla Genetics Expanded is an overhaul to a popular mod by Sarg Bjornson called Genetic Rim. The mechanics of the predecessor have been improved greatly to fit Vanilla Expanded playstyle, offering many new paths to explore in a mid to late game colony. You can now incubate unique hybrids using brand new genetic engineering system, utilising powerful boosters and genoframes to create animals stronger, smarter and quicker than anything you've ever seen. Stay vigilant though, as there is always a chance of an experiment failing, producing one of many new failure outcomes - such as cute and cuddly fleshlings, or powerful, ever-expanding fleshgrowth.
	
	Venture out into the unknown with a new abandoned lab quest, procure equipment needed to continue experiments, breed paragon creatures - a real pinacle of bio-engineering, and in the end give life to an Archocentipede through a brand new path to end the game.
	
	Vanilla Genetics Expanded introduces a Hybrid quality system, encouraging the player to create higher-quality hybrids which get improved stats across the board. Alternatively, focus on overwhelming the enemy with hordes of lower quality beasts. At the end of the day, it's all up to you.
	
	With Ideology DLC, two new memes will allow you to explore different avenues of the bio-engineering path. Will you be a wicked scientist? Or will you follow things by the book?
